> Demonstration of actions and state transitions
> Actions model operations that change state
> Primed expressions (f') refer to values after the operation

User.
Account.
balance a: Account => Int.
owner a: Account => User.

> Action: no return type means it modifies state
~> Deposit | a: Account, amount: Nat.

---
> In a chapter with an action, you can use primed expressions
> The parameters of the action are in scope

> Balance increases by the deposit amount
balance' a = balance a + amount.

> Owner doesn't change
owner' a = owner a.

> Other accounts are unchanged (frame condition)
all other: Account | other != a -> balance' other = balance other.
all other: Account | other != a -> owner' other = owner other.

> Pre-condition: can always deposit
all a: Account, amt: Nat | true.

where

> A second chapter for withdrawals
~> Withdraw | a: Account, amount: Nat.

---
> Balance decreases by withdrawal amount
balance' a = balance a - amount.

> Implicit constraint: balance must support the withdrawal
balance a >= amount.

> Frame condition
all other: Account | other != a -> balance' other = balance other.

where

> A third chapter for transfers between accounts
~> Transfer | from: Account, to: Account, amount: Nat.

---
> Source balance decreases
balance' from = balance from - amount.

> Destination balance increases
balance' to = balance to + amount.

> Pre-conditions
from != to.
balance from >= amount.

> Frame: other accounts unchanged
all other: Account | other != from and other != to ->
    balance' other = balance other.
